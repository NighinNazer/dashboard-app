Project Description
A web app that obsessively tracks your mouse movements, clicks, and hover times in real-time, then turns the data into colorful, animated charts. It even lets you save or export it—because you totally need proof of how much you hovered over that one button.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People are losing sleep at night wondering, “How many pixels did my mouse travel today?” The world needs answers.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a dashboard that measures your mouse’s every move, click, and hover, then dresses the data in fancy charts. It’s like Google Analytics—but for your cursor.
